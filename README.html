Debate El derecho a /mint currency/ se ha limitado a lo largo del tiempo 
a determinados grupos de la poblacion /because of difficulties in establishing
counterfeit-proof tokens of concrete value/. Mediante el enlace de identidades 
de la vida real a entradas /blockchain/ es posible el extender este derecho a 
grupos puntuales en una gestion que evite en todo momento el fraude y promueva 
/fair market valuation for arbitrary tokens/. En cierto sentido, /group
currency/ es un concepto que no tiene nada nuevo. Las empresas clasicas verifican 
las identidades de sus empleados, /they provide them with a living wage/,
/give out shares with voting rights/, /and are required by law/ para entregar
transparencia en sus movimientos contables y financieros. *Es adecuado concebir 
las /group currencies/ como vias de conformar empresas mas eficientes, transparentes, 
difuminadas y /on-the-fly companies/.* * *Vea tambien: Casos de ejemplo <#Examples>* Renta minima Los autores consideran la importancia de una renta minima y la ven como un asunto obvio y que aumenta imperiosamente su grado de relevancia, por ende es vital para el funcionamiento de cualquier sistema monetario. Los miembros de una /group currency all mint cryptographic tokens (coins, shares, what-have-you) at
an equal rate/. /This rate may change, but it should approximate a basic
income for each group member. Identified Members In cryptocurrencies
that provide a basic income/, /the equivalent of traditional
counterfeiting/ es la creacion de identidades falsas, tambien conocidas como un /Sybil attack/. El valor de una /group currency/ en el mercado podria depender en parte de su efectividad en el manejo de tales ataques. /Sybil
mitigation/ es tema para debate en *ApendiceA <#ApendiceA>*. /Group Fund Group
currencies are encouraged to implement a *group fund*/ al cual sus miembros contribuyen por omision y de manera automatizada con un porcentaje de su tenta minima. Los miembros *deben* ser capaces de realizar un /opt-out/ de sus contribuciones, pero al llevar a cabo dichas acciones deben perder la capacidad de votar en /group funds are used/. /Group
members vote using their tokens/. Esto entrega a los miembros un medio para asignar la importancia debida a /an issue has to them/. 
Previos intentos de “$1 = 1 vote” fail to acknowledge the asymmetry that exists in the creation of fiat currencies and are therefore unfair/. /Group currencies, however, extend the right to mint currency equally to every member of the group/, y por ende hacen atractivo este sistema de votacion de la misma forma que conservan su equidad. The purpose of a group fund is to provide the group with a means to invest in the group itself (i.e. value creation of some
sort). We believe such a scheme will result in the creation of more
value that is properly incentive-aligned with the interests of the group
itself, and therefore may have pro-social consequences in addition to
increasing the value of the group’s currency. Example Use Cases Group
currencies can be used to monetize virtually anything of value, in fact
they are perfectly suited for it. The inspiration for this idea came
from a desire to make pro-social value creation easier to achieve
(without resorting to advertising, outside investment, or donations). *
*Privacy conscious developers* can finance their efforts by monetizing
any activity their application facilitates. Developers of various
applications can form a group and choose to accept their group’s
currency for arbitrary features. Want to send secure messages longer
than X characters or to more than Y members? Z tokens will make that
possible. Such mechanisms have the added benefit of protecting users
from spam (it’s cheap to message to your friends, but expensive to spam
the world). * *Student researchers or professors* can finance their
research by forming groups (across classrooms, departments,
universities, etc.) and charging access to the value they create
(research papers, their professional time, etc.). * *Game developers*
can finance the development of their next big hit by forming a group and
accepting their group’s currency for in-game assets. This model is
already used via in-app purchases, but currently a middle-man takes a
cut and their virtual “gems” cannot be exchanged for value outside the
game. * *A town, city, state or country* can provide its community with
a basic income that is backed by the value created by that community.
*Any value-creation activity can now be easily financed without annoying
your own customers with advertisements or betraying their privacy.* FAQ
*What is the purpose of having many currencies?* Have a look at the
example use cases above <#Examples> and consider how each would fair if
they were to restrict themselves to dollars or bitcoins. Our brilliant
researchers would start out with *$0* and would have to resort to
traditional grant-writing and other means of extracting money out of
others before they could begin work. /"We're sorry, the NIH grant quota
has been filled for the year. Your miracle cure will have to wait."/ If
instead they formed a group issuing its own currency (say,
*AcademicCoin*), they would be able to *immediately*: 1. Provide others
with a token that represents the group's value and potential as human
beings. That is already non-zero (researchers are very valuable!). 2.
Exchange this token for some other token of value (like a Bitcoin) that
they could then use to finance their research. In the future, the
*AcademicCoin* is very valuable. It represents 1000+ respected
researchers who accept it as payment for their time, early access to
research results, papers, etc. It provides these academics with
something vital: *a basic income* (early tenure). The freedom to think
on matters other than survival is no longer restricted to nobility . The
market, in turn, provides them with feedback on their performance
through the price of *AcademicCoin*. *Can an individual receive multiple
basic incomes by being part of multiple groups?* Yes. Most newly formed
groups will be unable to provide all their members with a basic income,
so an individual may be able to accumulate a basic income for themselves
by being accepted into multiple groups. In exchange for membership, most
groups will likely expect their members to contribute value in some way,
and most groups will likely be capable of booting members that they've
decided are abusing the system. *Will it be a hassle to hold many
different currencies?* No. At least, there is absolutely no reason for
it to be. In this era of cryptocurrencies and decentralized exchanges ,
software can make conversions between different "tokens" or "coins" as
seamless as if no conversion took place. Say you visit a website selling
Pink Widgets for PinkCoins. You only have TurtleCoins. That doesn't
matter because your TurtleCoins can be quickly converted into PinkCoins
on a decentralized exchange. The software can even show you prices only
in terms of your TurtleCoins so you don't have to think about PinkCoins
(unless you want to). Implementations Currencies that fit the definition

membership, ensure it is publicly auditable, do proper KYC on new
members, and keep the group size *small*, the Sybil attack is of little
concern. It is when groups allow arbitrary membership that combating the
Sybil attack becomes of paramount importance for the currency. Below are
some resources for this. Please feel free to add to this list! *
Wikipedia on Sybil Attack * TrustDavis * uCoin’s Web-of-Trust system *
Dominic Williams argues a network has Sybil resistance if there are
costs associated with joining the network, staying in the network, and
leaving the network due to misbehavior . * BitVote’s OnePerID * Criminal
punishment (i.e. same as counterfeiting). Appendix B: Related Work and

Recommendations * Use a decentralized atomic swap exchange like Mercury
. There should be no friction for users to convert between your token
and others. If there is, your token/coin will become unattractice, and
that will decrease its value relative to other currencies. * UI should
be the same whether users come with Bitcoins or any other coin. Mercury
makes this possible. * Be transparent in issuance of tokens! If it’s
unclear how your issuance works, your currency could be devalued on the
market /and/ you might run afoul of the law! This info must be public as
otherwise it is difficult (or impossible) to properly value your coin. *
Pick a blockchain infrastructure/protocol/design that is flexible and
allows your group members to tweak value over time (for example,
increase or decrease the basic income amount). License This work is
